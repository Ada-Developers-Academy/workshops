# Ada Developers Academy Spring Workshop

## How will this work?
Teams of 4-5 people will work together with a coach on a guided project. The coaches will follow along with the team to ensure everyone is progressing along and stop for discussion points along the way. 

After our time together is coming to a close, we will de-brief what we have learned as well as provide additional recommendations and resources to assist you in taking your projects and learning to the next level.

## Intro to Ruby

### What is Ruby?
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is...
A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Like learning any new language, getting good at Ruby will just take practice. You'll find over time that there's nothing "magic" about programming - you're issuing commands that a computer understands and can execute.

#### Why Ruby?

Ruby is different than other programming languages. It was written with the human in mind, rather than the computer. Its creator, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, wanted to create a programming language that was fun for programmers.

Ruby was first written in 1993 by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. Many of the design concepts were taken from Perl and SmallTalk. One of the unique things about Ruby is the core cultural principles associated with the language, much of which was influenced by Matz.

### Ruby is for People

> "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language."

A well-written line of Ruby code can be read aloud, and a non-programmer should be able to understand it.

In the Ruby community, we try to focus on the people, not the machines.

> Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.
